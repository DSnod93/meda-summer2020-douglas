<h1>How to watch a movie</h1>
<p>Greetings, I am Douglas Snoddy Jr a first-generation college graduate. I was born in Atlanta, Georgia and am currently living in Oakland, California with my two brothers and mom. A hobby that I do frequently is watching movies. This is one of my favorite hobbies because I can experience a set of different emotions. I also enjoy the feeling of being in the movie and picturing myself in "what if" situations. In addition, it is also something I do when I am feeling stressed out. This is a hobby that anyone can pick up and it is accessible anywhere.
</p>

<p>Sometimes choosing a movie to watch can be daunting because there is a vast collection. Today, movies can be accessed from more than just the home. You can watch them on a tablet, computer, phone, video game console, or a tv. With <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media"> streaming services</a> such as Netflix, Amazon Video, Hulu, and Disney-plus you do not need to own a physical copy of the movie you would like to watch. If you prefer to own a physical copy of the movie then you want to make sure that you have the appropriate device that supports the movie. You will find that some discs say they support DVD, HDDVD, or Blu-Ray. Some computers may require you to download additional software in order to watch the movie.
</p>

<h2>Why a physical copy</h2>

<p>An upside to owning a physical copy of a disc is that you can watch this movie whenever youâ€™d like. The collection of movies you own will start to grow and soon you may find that you need to keep them in a place where they are easily accessible. I would suggest buying an organizer that would allow you to store your DVDs, so that you are not scrambling to find where you put a movie.  In addition, by owning a physical copy, you can trade and sell if you are no longer interested in keeping it. In the long term this could be beneficial. However, the more copies you own means more boxes and packing when you choose to move.</p>

<h2>Why stream</h2>

<p>On the other hand, if you prefer to stream movies through Netflix or Hulu you just need a device that is connected to the internet. In addition, you may have to download these streaming applications onto the device. Keep in mind that some streaming platforms have a subscription fee associated with them. Some platforms like YouTube and Crackle offer free services with some subscriptions. A benefit of using these platforms include being able to search through genres, actors, and starting the movie instantly with the press of a button.
</p>

<p>Furthermore streaming will require a stable internet connection. For example, Youtube allows you to watch videos in standard definition or high definiton. If you choose to watch videos in High Definition it would require at least  5 <a href="https://dailywireless.org/internet/what-is-mbps/"> Mbps</a>. The highest this number is the more stable your connection will be. This also means fewer to no interruptions. Keep in mind the more devices you have connected, the slower your streaming will be. </p>

<p>If you have cable service like Comcast or Dish network, these services have their own networks that allow the streaming of free and paid movies. You can find these movies by hitting the "On Demand" setting on the remote. You can also hit the menu button and search for movies that way. If these options are not available you can always use the guide option and scroll through the networks. Networks like TNT, USA, and Spike TV for example, also show movies, but they are broadcasted and have commercials.

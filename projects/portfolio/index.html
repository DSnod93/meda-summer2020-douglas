        <h2>Who I am</h2>
        <p id="blocktext">My name is Douglas Snoddy Jr and I am an aspiring Web Developer out of Oakland, California. I
            currently work at Mission
            High School in San Francisco, CA as a paraeducator.I am a team player and have lots of patience as well as
            being detail oriented. I have a passion to keep learning and am organized. When faced with problems I
            communicate effectively with my coworkers.</p>



        <h2>What I hope to do</h2>
        <p>My plan is to continue my learning and become a better developer personally and professionally. Every day is
            a
            chance to improve one's self and learn something new. On my free time I enjoy playing video games and
            spending time with family. In addition, I enjoy going to the gym and traveling. So far I have been to New
            York and Boston. My next steps are to get my passport and travel outside of the country. I also utilize my
            free time by continuing to code.</p>
